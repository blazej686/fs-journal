# MVC

bcw create in the powershell 


start with router and set view and controller 
do some HTML work
app state hold global vars
controller is export functions 
event emitter tells all code of the change. 
event listener can use for updating 
app.state.on 

first thing when working with an API start by making controller and service as we need to know if we can get the data from the API. 

you should always use a try catch when you write a function that is talking with an API.
a pop.error for uses and a log for devs.
